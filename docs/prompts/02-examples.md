# Examples Documentation for Grove Meta

You are documenting Grove Meta, the meta-CLI and package manager for the Grove ecosystem.

## Task
Create three practical examples that demonstrate Grove Meta's capabilities with increasing complexity.

## Required Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage
- Show initial setup and basic commands
- Demonstrate installing and managing a single Grove tool
- Include `grove list`, `grove install`, and basic verification
- Show the fundamental package management workflow

### Example 2: Advanced Workflow
- Demonstrate managing multiple tools in a development workflow
- Show workspace organization and project setup
- Include binary management and version coordination
- Highlight integration between different Grove tools

### Example 3: Development Environment Setup
- Show complete development environment configuration
- Demonstrate local development builds with `grove dev`
- Include managing both release and development versions
- Show the meta-CLI orchestrating complex development workflows

## Output Format
- Each example should have clear headings (e.g., "Example 1: Basic Usage")
- Include both the commands and the context for why you'd use them
- Show expected outcomes and results
- Provide commentary on when to use each pattern
- Include practical, real-world scenarios that developers would actually encounter
